However, if they are exposed to Covid-19 and are not yet fully vaccinated, or are immunocompromised I would recommend they look into the antibody treatment, with hesitation. The press release says adverse events occured in 20% of those who received antibody cocktail and 29% of those who received placebo, so I would first want to know the severity of these adverse effects and who was specifically affected. The study had rather low racial diversity, but a fair representation of participants with risk factors. I would like to know how much of the adverse effects were in the high risk group prior to recommending the treatment to my high risk family members and friends. 38% of participants were over 50, which I find comforting for recommending to older family members.
